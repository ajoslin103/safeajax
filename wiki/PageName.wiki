= Introduction =

safeAjax

I wrote this plugin to password protect web pages/sites 
and also to safeguard my ajax communications and sql access.  

It's originally based upon chris shifletts article: the truth about sessions 

This plugin requires a server-based connector which
does the testing of the connection as well as the 
password and access level validation prior to executing 
any sql statements.
