=== Summary ===

General information about the safeAjax plugin by Allen Joslin

=== Introduction ===

I wrote this plugin to password protect web pages/sites and also to safeguard my ajax communications and sql access.

It's originally based upon chris shifletts article: the truth about sessions

This plugin requires a server-based connector which does the testing of the connection as well as the password and access level validation prior to executing any sql statements.

This version 2 has been reorganized from version one and includes a new drop-in methodology for easily extending the server-side codebase

=== Usage === 

At this time there are several plugins that safeAjax depends upon, the next version will load them automatically -- for now you have to include them yourself 

{{{
	<script type='text/javascript'     src='http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.pack.js'></script>
	<script type="text/javascript"     src="http://www.json.org/json2.js"></script>
	<link type="text/css" media="all" href="http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/jqModal.css" rel="stylesheet" />
	<script type="text/javascript"     src="http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/jqModal.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript"     src="http://plugins.jquery.com/files/jquery.sha1.js.txt"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript"     src="http://plugins.jquery.com/files/jquery.query-2.1.5.js.txt"></script>
}}}

Now add a safeAjax div anywhere in your document, note that safeAjax uses console logging for errors and progress info

{{{
	<div id="safeAjax"></div>
}}}

Then include safeAjax and identify the connector

{{{
	<script type="text/javascript"      src="./lib/safeAjax/jquery.safeAjax_v2.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
	$(document).ready(function() {
		$('#safeAjax').safeAjax({ ajaxConnector: "./lib/safeAjax/dbConnector.php" });
	});
	</script>
}}}
