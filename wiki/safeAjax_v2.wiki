= Introduction =

I wrote this plugin to password protect web pages/sites and also to safeguard my ajax communications and sql access.

It's originally based upon chris shifletts article: the truth about sessions

This plugin requires a server-based connector which does the testing of the connection as well as the password and access level validation prior to executing any sql statements.

This version 2 has been reorganized from version one and includes a new drop-in methodology for easily extending the server-side codebase

== Usage ==
